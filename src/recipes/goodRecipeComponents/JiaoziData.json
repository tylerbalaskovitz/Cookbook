(Alternatively, very finely chop the cabbage and place in a colander. Sprinkle lightly with salt, toss to combine, and let sit for 10 minutes.)

Add the pork, scallions, garlic chives, garlic, ginger, soy sauce, and sesame oil and use your hands to combine; do not overwork or the filling will be tough.

   "step": "    To fill the dumplings: Have a small bowl of water ready. Place a dumpling wrapper in the flat of your hand. Place a scant tablespoon of the filling in the center of the wrapper. Dip a finger in the water and use it to wet the edges of the wrapper. Fold the dumpling in half to form a half-moon shape, pressing out the air as you seal the dumpling. If desired, use your opposite thumbs to fold a tiny pleat on either side of the dumpling, then press firmly to seal the dumpling closed. Place on a baking sheet. Repeat until all the filling is used, you will have extra wrappers.",

Add enough dumplings for a singler layer but leave enough space so that they do not touch. Add 1/4 cup of water (be careful, as it will splatter!) and immediately cover the pan. Cook on medium heat for 3 minutes, then uncover and continue to cook until all the water has evaporated and the bottoms are browned and crispy.",
